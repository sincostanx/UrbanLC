        gamma: Focal loss power factor
        alpha: Weight factor to balance positive and negative samples. Alpha must be in [0...1] range,
            high values will give more weight to positive class.
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            'none' | 'mean' | 'sum' | 'batchwise_mean'. 'none': no reduction will be applied,
            'mean': the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, 'sum': the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`.
            'batchwise_mean' computes mean loss per sample in batch. Default: 'mean'
